# GSLC-2
This is the GSLC project for session 9
Here we have interface and abstract

The Details of interface and abstract is in the class action and clothing

# The difference between interface and Abstract
Interface :
	- Collection of methods signatures, not what inside the method
	- Must be implemented by classes
	- A class can implement multiple interface
	- uses the implements keyword
	
Abstract :
	- Can have both abstract and non-abstract methods
	- Can have variables, constructors, and methods
	- A class can extend 1 abstract
	- uses the extends keyword
